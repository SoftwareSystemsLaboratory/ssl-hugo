 abstract = {Presentation at CyberColombia's Third HPC Summer School: Bio and Data Science Part 1 describes our work on developing a neurocomputational model inspired in specific features found in the mammalian cortex. Part 2 describes our software development efforts to build an HPC version of our work aimed at scalability on leadership class supercomputers, including a discussion of our strong and weak scaling results to date. Part 3 describes our efforts with software engineering and reproducibilty with a discussion of best practices for working with open source and hosting code, datasets, and analyses.},
