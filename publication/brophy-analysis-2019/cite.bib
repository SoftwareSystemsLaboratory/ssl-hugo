 abstract = {Previous research provides a method for reducing the subjectivity in molar tooth identification of animals in the family Bovidae, by quantifying the occlusal surface of teeth using elliptical Fourier analysis. This current paper specifically tests what effect teeth with medium to late wear have on the identification of bovid teeth when using the form (size and shape) of the occlusal surface to classify specimens.},
