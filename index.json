Engineers can reduce costs by reusing a pre-trained model (PTM) and fine-tuning it for their own tasks. To facilitate software reuse, engineers collaborate around model hubs, collections of PTMs and datasets organized by problem domain. Although model hubs are now comparable in popularity and size to other software ecosystems, the associated PTM supply chain has not yet been examined from a software engineering perspective. We present an empirical study of artifacts and security features in 8 model hubs. We indicate the potential threat models and show that the existing defenses are insufficient for ensuring the security of PTMs. We compare PTM and traditional supply chains, and propose directions for further measurements and tools to increase the reliability of the PTM supply chain.","tags":["Machine learning","Empirical software engineering","Deep neural networks","Model hubs","Software reuse","Software supply chain"],"title":"An Empirical Study of Artifacts and Security Risks in the Pre-Trained Model Supply Chain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yucheng Yang","Jack West","George K.

State-of-the-art computer vision techniques rely on large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are usually too power-hungry to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. Many techniques improve DNN efficiency of DNNs by compromising accuracy. However, the accuracy and efficiency of these techniques cannot be adapted for diverse edge applications with different hardware constraints and accuracy requirements. This paper demonstrates that a recent, efficient tree-based DNN architecture, called the hierarchical DNN, can be converted into a Directed Acyclic Graph-based (DAG) architecture to provide tunable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff options. We propose a systematic method that identifies the connections that must be added to convert the tree to a DAG to improve accuracy. We conduct experiments on popular edge devices and show that increasing the connectivity of the DAG improves the accuracy to within 1% of the existing high accuracy techniques. Our approach requires 93% less memory, 43% less energy, and 49% fewer operations than the high accuracy techniques, thus providing more accuracy-efficiency configurations.","tags":[],"title":"Directed Acyclic Graph-Based Neural Networks for Tunable Low-Power Computer Vision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George K.

State-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are too large for inference on low-power edge devices. To improve efficiency, some existing approaches parallelize DNN inference across multiple edge devices. However, these techniques introduce significant communication and synchronization overheads or are unable to balance workloads across devices. This paper demonstrates that the hierarchical DNN architecture is well suited for parallel processing on multiple edge devices. We design a novel method that creates a parallel inference pipeline for computer vision problems that use hierarchical DNNs. The method balances loads across the collaborating devices and reduces communication costs to facilitate the processing of multiple video frames simultaneously with higher throughput. Our experiments consider a representative computer vision problem where image recognition is performed on each video frame, running on multiple Raspberry Pi 4Bs. With four collaborating low-power edge devices, our approach achieves 3.21X higher throughput, 68% less energy consumption per device per frame, and 58% decrease in memory when compared with existing single-device hierarchical DNNs.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Computer Vision on Edge Devices with Pipeline-Parallel Hierarchical Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jakob Veselsky","Jack West","Isaac Ahlgren","George K.

These techniques are applied in contexts as diverse as astronomy and spam filtering. However, correctly applying these techniques requires careful engineering. Much attention has been paid to the technical potential; relatively little attention has been paid to the software engineering process required to bring research-based machine learning techniques into practical utility. Technology companies have supported the engineering community through machine learning frameworks such as TensorFLow and PyTorch, but the details of how to engineer complex machine learning models in these frameworks have remained hidden. To promote best practices within the engineering community, academic institutions and Google have partnered to launch a Special Interest Group on Machine Learning Models (SIGMODELS) whose goal is to develop exemplary implementations of prominent machine learning models in community locations such as the TensorFlow Model Garden (TFMG). The purpose of this report is to define a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model at a level of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG. We define the engineering process and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release. We report on our experiences implementing the YOLO model family with a team of 26 student researchers, share the tools we developed, and describe the lessons we learned along the way.","tags":[],"title":"An Experience Report on Machine Learning Reproducibility: Guidance for Practitioners and TensorFlow Model Garden Contributors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Dailey","Aniesh Chawla","Andrew Liu","Sripath Mishra","Ling Zhang","Josh Majors","Yung-Hsiang Lu","George K.

We create a general and automated solution for aggregating Network Camera data spread across thousands of uniquely structured webpages. We analyze heterogeneous webpage structures and identify common characteristics among 73 sample Network Camera websites (each website has multiple web pages).

Devices can pair with one another by continuously harvesting environmental noise to generate a random key with no user involvement. However, there are gaps in our understanding of the theoretical limitations of environmental noise harvesting, making it difficult for researchers to build efficient algorithms for sampling environmental noise and distilling keys from that noise. This work explores the information-theoretic capacity of context-based authentication mechanisms to generate random bit strings from environmental noise sources with known properties. Using only mild assumptions about the source process's characteristics, we demonstrate that commonly-used bit extraction algorithms extract only about 10% of the available randomness from a source noise process. We present an efficient algorithm to improve the quality of keys generated by context-based methods and evaluate it on real key extraction hardware. Moonshine is a randomness distiller which is more efficient at extracting bits from an environmental entropy source than existing methods. Our techniques nearly double the quality of keys as measured by the NIST test suite, producing keys that can be used in real-world authentication scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Moonshine: An Online Randomness Distiller for Zero-Involvement Authentication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory J.

Surveillance cameras are most useful when they are spaced out to maximize coverage of an area. However, deciding where to place cameras is an NP-hard problem and researchers have proposed heuristic solutions. Existing work does not consider a significant restriction of computer vision: in order to track a moving object, the object must occupy enough pixels. The number of pixels depends on many factors (How far away is the object? What is the camera resolution? What is the focal length?). In this study, we propose a camera placement method that identifies effective camera placement in arbitrary spaces and can account for different camera types as well. Our strategy represents spaces as polygons, then uses a greedy algorithm to partition the polygons and determine the cameras’ locations to provide the desired coverage. Our solution also makes it possible to perform object tracking via overlapping camera placement. Our method is evaluated against complex shapes and real-world museum floor plans, achieving up to 85% coverage and 25% overlap.","tags":[],"title":"Camera Placement Meeting Restrictions of Computer Vision","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dario Dematties","Silvio B.

The feature-based indexing technique provides an effective way for users to search video content through visual features, such as object categories (e.g., cars and persons). However, due to the reliance on offline processing, video streams along with their captured features cannot be searchable immediately after video streams are recorded. According to our investigation, buffering and storing live video steams are more time-consuming than the YOLO v3 object detector. Such observation motivates us to propose a real-time feature indexing (RTFI) system to enable instantaneous feature-based indexing on live video streams after video streams are captured and processed through object detectors. RTFI achieves its real-time goal via incorporating the novel design of metadata structure and data placement, the capability of modern object detector (i.e., YOLO v3), and the deduplication techniques to avoid storing repetitive video content. Notably, RTFI is the first system design for realizing real-time feature-based indexing on live video streams. RTFI is implemented on a Linux server and can improve the system throughput by upto 10.60x, compared with the base system without the proposed design. In addition, RTFI is able to make the video content searchable within 20 milliseconds for 10 live video streams after the video content is received by the proposed system, excluding the network transfer latency.","tags":[],"title":"A Real-Time Feature Indexing System on Live Video Streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhinav Goel","Caleb Tung","Yung-Hsiang Lu","George K.

Recent research improves DNN models by reducing the memory requirement, energy consumption, and number of operations without significantly decreasing the accuracy. This paper surveys the progress of low-power deep learning and computer vision, specifically in regards to inference, and discusses the methods for compacting and accelerating DNN models. The techniques can be divided into four major categories: (1) parameter quantization and pruning, (2) compressed convolutional filters and matrix factorization, (3) network architecture search, and (4) knowledge distillation.

FLIC is targeted toward city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices in which each node gathers and shares data with surrounding devices. As machine learning and other data processing techniques that require large volumes of training data are ported to low-cost and low-power IoT systems, we expect that data analysis will be moved away from the cloud. Separation from the cloud will reduce reliance on power-hungry centralized cloud-based infrastructure. However, city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT devices often connect to the Internet with cellular service, in which service charges are proportional to network usage. IoT system architects must be clever in order to keep costs down in these scenarios. To reduce the network bandwidth required to operate city-scale deployments of cooperative IoT systems, FLIC implements a distributed cache on the IoT nodes in the fog. FLIC allows the IoT network to share its data without repetitively interacting with a simple cloud storage service, reducing calls out to a backing store. Our results displayed a less than 2% miss rate on reads. Thus, allowing for only 5% of requests needing the backing store. We were also able to achieve more than 50% reduction in bytes transmitted per second.","tags":[],"title":"FLIC: A Distributed Fog Cache for City-Scale Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dario Dematties","Silvio Rizzi","George K.

Although several theories have advanced arguments regarding the neurocomputational bases of this phenomenon, we argue that these theories could potentially benefit by including neurophysiological data concerning cortical dynamics constraints in brain tissue. In addition, some theories promote the integration of complex optimization methods in neural tissue. In this paper we attempt to fill these gaps introducing a computational model inspired in the dynamics of cortical tissue. In our modeling approach, proximal afferent dendrites produce stochastic cellular activations, while distal dendritic branches–on the other hand–contribute independently to somatic depolarization by means of dendritic spikes, and finally, prediction failures produce massive firing events preventing formation of sparse distributed representations. The model presented in this paper combines semantic and coarse-grained syntactic constraints for each word in a sentence context until grammatically related word function discrimination emerges spontaneously by the sole correlation of lexical information from different sources without applying complex optimization methods. By means of support vector machine techniques, we show that the sparse activation features returned by our approach are well suited—bootstrapping from the features returned by Word Embedding mechanisms—to accomplish grammatical function classification of individual words in a sentence. In this way we develop a biologically guided computational explanation for linguistically relevant unification processes in cortex which connects psycholinguistics to neurobiological accounts of language. We also claim that the computational hypotheses established in this research could foster future work on biologically-inspired learning algorithms for natural language processing applications.","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Theory for the Emergence of Grammatical Categories in Cortical Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brook Abegaz","Eric Chan-Tin","Neil Klingensmith","George K.

Many of these risks can be partly attributed to the use of a training image dataset that exhibits sampling biases and thus does not accurately reflect the real visual world. Being able to detect potential sampling biases in the visual dataset prior to model development is thus essential for mitigating the fairness and trustworthy concerns in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a three-step crowdsourcing workflow to get humans into the loop for facilitating bias discovery in image datasets. Through two sets of evaluation studies, we find that the proposed workflow can effectively organize the crowd to detect sampling biases in both datasets that are artificially created with designed biases and real-world image datasets that are widely used in computer vision research and system development.","tags":[],"title":"Crowdsourcing Detection of Sampling Biases in Image Datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhinav Goel","Caleb Tung","Sara Aghajanzadeh","Isha Ghodgaonkar","Shreya Ghosh","George K.

Object counting takes two inputs: an image and an object query and reports the number of occurrences of the queried object. To achieve high accuracy, DNNs require billions of operations, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained, low-power devices. Prior work shows that a significant number of DNN operations are redundant and can be eliminated without affecting the accuracy. To reduce these redundancies, we propose a hierarchical DNN architecture for object counting. This architecture uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose regions-of-interest (RoIs) that may contain the queried objects. A hierarchical classifier then efficiently finds the RoIs that actually contain the queried objects. The hierarchy contains groups of visually similar object categories. Small DNNs at each node of the hierarchy classify between these groups. The RoIs are incrementally processed by the hierarchical classifier. If the object in an RoI is in the same group as the queried object, then the next DNN in the hierarchy processes the RoI further; otherwise, the RoI is discarded. By using a few small DNNs to process each image, this method reduces the memory requirement, inference time, energy consumption, and number of operations with negligible accuracy loss when compared with the existing techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Power Object Counting with Hierarchical Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isha Ghodgaonkar","Abhinav Goel","Fischer Bordwell","Caleb Tung","Sara Aghajanzadeh","Noah Curran","Ryan Chen","Kaiwen Yu","Sneha Mahapatra","Vishnu Banna","Gore Kao","Kate Lee","Xiao Hu","Nick Eliopolous","Akhil Chinnakotla","Damini Rijhwani","Ashley Kim","Aditya Chakraborty","Mark Daniel Ward","Yung-Hsiang Lu","George K.

A small bug in an application, library, or framework can lead to economic loss and even loss of life. We rely on software developers to be dynamic and responsive to user review and bug-reporting. Our team developed an open-source modular pipeline to perform empirical investigations of software quality. A key innovation of our approach is to look at projects “from a distance” similar to methods used in climate, e.g. satellite images being used to observe environmental impacts in air quality/rain forests. Instead of looking at language-specific source code features, our pipeline uses a language-agnostic high-level approach to track software quality by focusing on the development process itself, which yields great insight into the processes programmers use to write and maintain their software. Our distributed modular approach to analytics allows the pipeline to be easily extended to support additional metrics in future work. We store extracted data in an embedded SQLite database, which means that analysis can proceed without complex server setup, let alone hosting the software on dedicated servers.

Mean-while, Machine Learning (ML) based on established models has seena surge of interest in the High Performance Computing (HPC) com-munity, especially through the use of high-end accelerators, such asGraphical Processing Units (GPUs), including HPC clusters of same.In our work, we are motivated to exploit these high-performance com-puting developments and understand the scaling challenges for new–biologically inspired–learning models on leadership-class HPC resources.These emerging models feature sparse and random connectivity pro-files that map to more loosely-coupled parallel architectures with alarge number of CPU cores per node. Contrasted with traditional MLcodes, these methods exploit loosely-coupled sparse data structures asopposed to tightly-coupled dense matrix computations, which benefitfrom SIMD-style parallelism found on GPUs. In this paper we introducea hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing(OpenMP) parallelization scheme to accelerate and scale our computa-tional model based on the dynamics of cortical tissue. We ran compu-tational tests on a leadership class visualization and analysis cluster atArgonne National Laboratory. We include a study of strong and weakscaling, where we obtained parallel efficiency measures with a minimumabove 87% and a maximum above 97% for simulations of our biologicallyinspired neural network on up to 64 computing nodes running 8 threadseach. This study shows promise of the MPI+OpenMP hybrid approachto support flexible and biologically-inspired computational experimen-tal scenarios.

The manager then selects the most cost-efficient types of cloud instances (e.g., central processing unit versus general-purpose graphics processing units) to meet the computational demands for analyzing streams.

However, less attention has been given to psycholinguistic data and neurophysiological features recently found in cortical tissue. We focus on a context in which basic linguistic units–such as phonemes–are extracted and robustly classified by humans and other animals from complex acoustic streams in speech data. We are especially motivated by the fact that 8-month-old human infants can accomplish segmentation of words from fluent audio streams based exclusively on the statistical relationships between neighboring speech sounds without any kind of supervision. In this paper, we introduce a biologically inspired and fully unsupervised neurocomputational approach that incorporates key neurophysiological and anatomical cortical properties, including columnar organization, spontaneous micro-columnar formation, adaptation to contextual activations and Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) produced by means of partial N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) depolarization. Its feature abstraction capabilities show promising phonetic invariance and generalization attributes. Our model improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic word classification tasks in the presence of environmental disturbances such as white noise, reverberation, and pitch and voice variations. Furthermore, our approach emphasizes potential self-organizing cortical principles achieving improvement without any kind of optimization guidance which could minimize hypothetical loss functions by means of–for example–backpropagation. Thus, our computational model outperforms multiresolution spectro-temporal auditory feature representations using only the statistical sequential structure immerse in the phonotactic rules of the input stream.","tags":[],"title":"Phonetic Acquisition in Cortical Dynamics, a Computational Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caleb Tung","Matthew R.

The popular computer vision program, YOLO (\\\"You Only Look Once\\\"), has been shown to accurately detect objects in many major image datasets. However, the images found in those datasets, are independent of one another and cannot be used to test YOLO's consistency at detecting the same object as its environment (e.g. ambient lighting) changes. This paper describes a novel effort to evaluate YOLO's consistency for large-scale applications. It does so by working (a) at large scale and (b) by using consecutive images from a curated network of public video cameras deployed in a variety of real-world situations, including traf?c intersections, national parks, shopping malls, university campuses, etc. We speci?cally examine YOLO's ability to detect objects in different scenarios (e.g., daytime vs. night), leveraging the cameras' ability to rapidly retrieve many successive images for evaluating detection consistency. Using our camera network and advanced computing resources (supercomputers), we analyzedmorethan5millionimagescapturedby140network cameras in 24 hours. Compared with labels marked by humans (considered as \\\"ground truth\\\"), YOLO struggles to consistently detect the same humans and cars as their positions change from one frame to the next; it also struggles to detect objects at night time. Our ?ndings suggest that state-of-the art vision solutions should be trained by data from network camera with contextual information before they can be deployed in applications that demand high consistency on object detection.","tags":[],"title":"Large-Scale Object Detection of Images from Network Cameras in Variable Ambient Lighting Conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arfon Smith","Lorena A.

Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required.

The complexity and criticality of this software motivate the need for ensuring quality and reliability. Software metrics are a key tool for assessing, measuring, and understanding software quality and reliability. Aims: The goal of this work is to better understand how research software developers use traditional software engineering concepts, like metrics, to support and evaluate both the software and the software development process. One key aspect of this goal is to identify how the set of metrics relevant to research software corresponds to the metrics commonly used in traditional software engineering. Method: We surveyed research software developers to gather information about their knowledge and use of code metrics and software process metrics. We also analyzed the influence of demographics (project size, development role, and development stage) on these metrics. Results: The survey results, from 129 respondents, indicate that respondents have a general knowledge of metrics. However, their knowledge of specific SE metrics is lacking, their use even more limited. The most used metrics relate to performance and testing. Even though code complexity often poses a significant challenge to research software development, respondents did not indicate much use of code metrics. Conclusions: Research software developers appear to be interested and see some value in software metrics but may be encountering roadblocks when trying to use them.

Analyzing the content from many network cameras requires significant amounts of computing resources. Cloud vendors offer resources in the form of cloud instances with different capabilities and hourly costs. Some instances include GPUs that can accelerate analysis programs. Doing so incurs additional monetary cost because instances with GPUs are more expensive. It is a challenging problem to reduce the overall monetary cost of using the cloud to analyze the real-time multimedia content from network cameras while meeting the desired analysis frame rates. This paper describes a cloud resource manager that solves this problem by estimating the resource requirements of executing analysis programs using CPU or GPU, formulating the resource allocation problem as a multiple-choice vector bin packing problem, and solving it using an existing algorithm.

This manuscript expands on that previous work by exploring how different machine learning approaches classify the teeth and testing which technique is best for classification. Five different machine learning techniques including linear discriminant analysis, neural networks, nuclear penalized multinomial regression, random forests, and support vector machines were used to estimate these models. Support vector machines and random forests perform the best in terms of both log-loss and misclassification rate; both of these methods are improvements over linear discriminant analysis. With the identification and application of these superior methods, bovid teeth can be classified with higher accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"A Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Taxonomic Classification of Teeth from the Family Bovidae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed S.

Analyzing the content from many network cameras requires significant amounts of computing resources. Cloud vendors offer resources in the form of cloud instances with different capabilities and hourly costs. Some instances include GPUs that can accelerate analysis programs. Doing so incurs additional monetary cost because instances with GPUs are more expensive. It is a challenging problem to reduce the overall monetary cost of using the cloud to analyze the real-time multimedia content from network cameras while meeting the desired analysis frame rates. This paper describes a cloud resource manager that solves this problem by estimating the resource requirements of executing analysis programs using CPU or GPU, formulating the resource allocation problem as a multiple-choice vector bin packing problem, and solving it using an existing algorithm. The experiments show that the manager can reduce up to 61% of the cost compared with other allocation strategies.","tags":[],"title":"Analyzing Real-Time Multimedia Content From Network Cameras Using CPUs and GPUs in the Cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francis Sullivan","Norman Chonacky","Isabel Beichl","George K.

Many commercial systems have adopted distributed RDF graph systems in order to handle increasing dataset sizes and complex queries. This paper introduces a distribute graph approach to pre-processing linked data. Instead of traversing the memory graph, our system indexes pre-processed join elements that are organized in a graph structure. We analyze the Dbpedia data-set (derived from the Wikipedia corpus) and compare our access method to the graph traversal access approach which we also devise. Results show from our experiments that the distributed, pre-processed graph approach to accessing linked data is faster than the traversal approach over a specific range of linked queries.","tags":[],"title":"A Distributed Graph Approach for Pre-processing Linked RDF Data Using Supercomputers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kent Gauen","Ryan Dailey","John Laiman","Yuxiang Zi","Nirmal Asokan","Yung-Hsiang Lu","George K.

The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative and investigates object detection labels with respect to size, location, and contextual information.

Bovids in southern Africa are typically identified by their teeth. However, identifying the taxon of a bovid tooth is challenging due to various biasing factors. Furthermore, inaccurate identification of fossil bovids can have significant consequences on the reconstructed paleoenvironment. Recent research on the classification of bovid fossil teeth has relied on using elliptical Fourier analysis to summarize the shape of the outline of the occlusal surface of the tooth and the resulting harmonic amplitudes. Currently, an expert in the field must manually place landmarks around the edges of each tooth which is slow and time consuming. This study tests whether it is possible to crowdsource this task, while maintaining the necessary level of quality needed to perform a statistical analysis on each tooth. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers place landmarks on the edge of the tooth which is compared to the performance of an expert in the field. The results suggest that crowdsourcing the digitization process is reliable and replicable. With the technical aspects of digitization managed, researchers can concentrate on analyzing and interpreting the data.","tags":[],"title":"Examining the Use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk for Edge Extraction of the Occlusal Surface of Fossilized Bovid Teeth.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lorena A.

However, the complexity, breadth, and technical variations of these real-world products are difficult to reproduce in the classroom. This paper outlines preliminary work on a framework architecture suitable for academic teaching of modern embedded systems including the Internet of Things. It defines four layers, two of which are at the edges of the network, and not adequately covered in academia. For each layer of the architecture, specific technology and suitable devices are identified. Desired academic outcomes for courses using projects based on the architecture are identified.

We argue that true progress depends on embracing the best traditional–and emergent– practices in software engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the tradition of software engineering. Software engineering as practiced today is more than the stereotypical monolithic lifecycle processes (e.g. waterfall, spiral, etc.) that historically have impeded progress for small/medium sized development efforts. In addition, the discipline and practice of software engineering includes software quality (with an established tradition of software metrics). Software processes can be pragmatic and use best features/practices of various models without impeding developer productivity. The embracement of these practices may also be important to prevent a brain drain of sorts, as students are increasingly eschewing traditional scientific/computation science research in favor of industry opportunities, where they can literally apply what they have learned in software development courses where pragmatic software engineering practices (e.g. test-driven design, RESTful architecture, etc.) are already prevalent.\\\"","tags":[],"title":"Software Engineering Need not be Difficult","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Lewis","Konstantin Läufer","George K.

The Nintendo Wii, introduced in 2006, helped usher in a moment of retro-reinvention in video game play. This hugely popular console system, codenamed Revolution during development, signaled a turn away from fully immersive, time-consuming MMORPGs or forty-hour FPS games and back toward family fun in the living room. Players using the wireless motion-sensitive controller (the Wii Remote, or “Wiimote”) play with their whole bodies, waving, swinging, swaying. The mimetic interface shifts attention from what's on the screen to what's happening in physical space. This book describes the Wii's impact in technological, social, and cultural terms, examining the Wii as a system of interrelated hardware and software that was consciously designed to promote social play in physical space. Each chapter of Codename Revolution focuses on a major component of the Wii as a platform: the console itself, designed to be low-powered and nimble; the iconic Wii Remote; Wii Fit Plus, and its controller, the Wii Balance Board; the Wii Channels interface and Nintendo's distribution system; and the Wii as a social platform that not only affords multiplayer options but also encourages social interaction in shared physical space. Finally, the authors connect the Wii's revolution in mimetic interface gaming—which eventually led to the release of Sony's Move and Microsoft's Kinect—to some of the economic and technological conditions that influence the possibility of making something new in this arena of computing and culture.","tags":[],"title":"Codename Revolution: The Nintendo WII Platform (Platform Studies)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George K.

Platform studies is a quintessentially Digital Humanities approach, since it’s explicitly focused on the interrelationship of computing and cultural expression. According to the series preface, the goal of platform studies is “to consider the lowest level of computing systems and to understand how these systems relate to culture and creativity.”In practice, this involves paying close attentionto specific hardware and software interactions–to the vertical relationships between a platform’s multilayered materialities (Hayles; Kirschenbaum),from transistors to code to cultural reception. Any given act of platform-studies analysis may focus for example on the relationship between the chipset and the OS, or between the graphics processor and display parameters or game developers’ designs.In computing terms, platform is an abstraction(Bogost and Montfort), a pragmatic frame placed around whatever hardware-and-software configuration is required in order to build or run certain specificapplications (including creative works). The object of platform studies is thus a shifting series of possibility spaces, any number of dynamic thresholds between discrete levels of a system.","tags":[],"title":"The Object of Platform Studies: Relational Materialities and the Social Platform (the Case of the Nintendo Wii)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George K.
